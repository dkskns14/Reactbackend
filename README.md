Todo App Documentation Django

Introduction:
Django is an open-source Python web framework for backend web apps.

Step 1: Set Up a Django Project:

•	Install Django using pip and create a new Django project using the following commands:
install django
django-admin startproject todo_app
cd todo_app
 
Step 2: Create a Django App for Todo:

•	Create a new Django app for managing the Todo functionality:
python manage.py startapp todo
 
Step 3: Define the Todo Model:

•	In the models.py file of the todo app, define the Todo model with fields like title and completed. The model represents each task in the Todo app.
Step 4: Set Up the Database:

•	Configure the database settings in the project's settings.py file. You can use SQLite for development, or set up a different database like PostgreSQL for production.

Step 5: Create and Apply Migrations:

•	Create migrations for the Todo model and apply them to create the corresponding database table:
bashCopy codepython manage.py makemigrations todo
python manage.py migrate
 
Step 6: Set Up API Views:

•	Create API views using Django's class-based views or function-based views. These views will handle CRUD operations for the Todo model (Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks).

Step 7: Configure URL Patterns:

•	Set up URL patterns in the urls.py file of the todo app to map the API views to specific endpoints.

Step 8: Implement API Endpoints:

•	Define API endpoints in the views that will handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing tasks. These endpoints will interact with the Todo model to perform CRUD operations.

step 9:Frontend-Backend Integration

Ensure the frontend React app is running on a specific port (e.g., localhost:3000).
In Django settings, add the frontend's URL to the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS list to allow cross-origin requests.
Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or directly through the frontend to verify that CRUD operations work correctly.
